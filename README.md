# Snickerstream

** PLEASE NOTE **: The following release is a Proof of Concept (pre-alpha) and doesn't have
many planned features. There are also some known issues and many pieces of code aren't
polished properly.

** TL;DR - THIS RELEASE IS NOWHERE NEAR BEING COMPLETE. ** I strongly advice you to NOT use
it yet for anything serious (ex. streaming on Twitch or recording videos) until a
proper stable release is published.

## How to compile
You need AutoIt v3.3.14.2 or later to compile Snickerstream.

After you've downloaded and installed AutoIt, clone this repo to your hard drive and
use Aut2Exe to compile SnickerstreamPOC.au3 to an EXE file or open it in SciTE to run
the script without compiling.
